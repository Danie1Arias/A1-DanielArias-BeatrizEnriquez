    "# Student Performance in Exams\n",
    "This dataset provides a detailed snapshot of high school students' performance in exams, focusing on their scores in mathematics, reading, and writing. It includes essential demographic, social, and academic variables that are known to influence academic outcomes. The dataset consists of 1,000 observations, where each row represents a unique student, and includes various attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education levels, test preparation status, lunch type, and scores in three key academic subjects. This dataset can be leveraged to analyze trends, correlations, and disparities in academic performance based on socioeconomic and educational factors.\n",

    "| Attribute | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|Gender| \tThis column categorizes students by their gender (Male, Female). Allows for the exploration of gender-based performance trends in math, reading, and writing scores.|\n",
    "|Race/Ethnicity|Coded into five groups (Group A to Group E), this feature represents the racial or ethnic background of the student. Enables analysis of how ethnic backgrounds influence exam performance.|\n",
    "|Parental Level of Education|Describes the highest educational attainment of the student’s parents (e.g., High School, Some College, Associate’s Degree, Bachelor’s Degree, Master’s Degree). This variable is useful in understanding the impact of parental education on students' academic achievements.|\n",
    "|Lunch Type|Indicates whether the student receives a standard lunch or a free/reduced-price lunch. This feature can be used to study the relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance.|\n",
    "|Test Preparation Course|Describes whether the student completed a test preparation course (Completed or None). Examines the influence of structured test preparation on academic outcomes.|\n",
    "|Math Score|This column records the student’s performance in mathematics (on a scale of 0-100). A key outcome variable for assessing performance in a core subject.|\n",
    "|Reading Score|Similar to the math score, this feature captures the student’s performance in reading (on a scale of 0-100). Provides insight into students' literacy and comprehension abilities.|\n",
    "|Writing Score|Represents the student’s performance in writing (on a scale of 0-100). Allows for analysis of written communication skills and overall language proficiency.|\n",
